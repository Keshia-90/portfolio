    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img class="pic2" src="images\about-me-.jpg" alt="a little more about me">
    <p>I have always been interested in technology, in my house I am literally the person my family come to whenever they need a new phone or tablet set up. For instance, when my mum got a new phone and she wanted all her apps and information transferred onto her new phone, it was me who had to sort it out for her...come to think of it, I even had to do the same thing for my dad and my sister.</p>
    <p>I very rarely get time to myself (the joys of having two young children), but when I have the chance, I love spending my free time watching slasher/gore filmed films.</p>
    <p class="films">Here are a few of my favourite films:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Saw(the franchise)</li>
        <li>No One Lives</li>
        <li>You're Next</li>
        <li>Hostel(the franchise)</li>
        <li>American Mary</li>
        <li>Wolf Creek</li>
        <li>Wolf Creek 2</li>
        <li>The Collector</li>
        <li>The Collection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also enjoy playing games on the PS4, such as God of War, Assassin's Creed, Grand Theft Auto 5, Call of Duty(love all of them) and Horizon Zero Dawn.</p>
    <p>I am currently studying the Master Coding Course Skills Bootcamp, in which I am learning about coding using Java Script. This course, I applied for after completing/passing the 'Level 2 :Develop Coding Course at Code Nation Ltd' </p>
    <h2>Experience and Skills</h2>
    <img src="images\EXP-AND-SKILL-FINAL.jpg" alt="experience and skills">
    <p>When it comes to experience of coding, I have achieved the qualification 'Level 2 certificate in IT User Skills in Open Systems and Enterprise'. I am also working towards passing the Master Coding Course Skills Bootcamp, in which I have been learning about the use of Java Script. I also have experience in retail and have the Level 2 Retail Skill and Retail Knowledge, this helped me work in a retail environment for almost two years. </p>
    <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
    <img class="project" src="images\personalProject.jpg" alt="personal projects">
    <p>Whilst I was on the 3 week Develop Coding course, I had created a website. This was something I found very enjoyable, especially when I realised how much coding goes into creating a website.</p>
    <a class="web" href="https://keshia-90.github.io/First-website/" target="_blank">My first website</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Aswell as the website, I created a game in python. This was created in my own time as I wanted to put what I had learned into practice.</p>
